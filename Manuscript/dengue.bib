abstract = {The management of infectious diseases is an increasingly important public health issue, the effective implementation of which is often complicated by difficulties in teasing apart the relative roles of extrinsic and intrinsic factors influencing transmission. Dengue, a vector-borne strain polymorphic disease, is one such infection where transmission dynamics are affected by environmental variables as well as immune-mediated serotype interactions. To understand how alternative hypotheses concerning dengue infection and transmission may explain observed multiannual cycles in disease incidence, we adopt a theoretical approach that combines both ecological and immunological mechanisms. We demonstrate that, contrary to perceived wisdom, patterns generated solely by antibody-dependent enhancement or heterogeneity in virus virulence are not consistent with serotype-specific notification data in important ways. Furthermore, to generate epidemics with the characteristic signatures observed in data, we find that a combination of seasonal variation in vector demography and, crucially, a short-lived period of cross-immunity is sufficient. We then show how understanding the persistence and eradication of dengue serotypes critically depends on the alternative assumed mechanisms.},

abstract = {With the recent resurgence of vector-borne diseases due to urbanization and development there is an urgent need to understand the dynamics of vector-borne diseases in rapidly changing urban environments. For example, many empirical studies have produced the disturbing finding that diseases continue to persist in modern city centers with zero or low rates of transmission. We develop spatial models of vector-borne disease dynamics on a network of patches to examine how the movement of humans in heterogeneous environments affects transmission. We show that the movement of humans between patches is sufficient to maintain disease persistence in patches with zero transmission. We construct two classes of models using different approaches: (i) Lagrangian models that mimic human commuting behavior and (ii) Eulerian models that mimic human migration. We determine the basic reproduction number R(0) for both modeling approaches. We show that for both approaches that if the disease-free equilibrium is stable (R(0)<1) then it is globally stable and if the disease-free equilibrium is unstable (R(0)>1) then there exists a unique positive (endemic) equilibrium that is globally stable among positive solutions. Finally, we prove in general that Lagrangian and Eulerian modeling approaches are not equivalent. The modeling approaches presented provide a framework to explore spatial vector-borne disease dynamics and control in heterogeneous environments. As an example, we consider two patches in which the disease dies out in both patches when there is no movement between them. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the disease becomes endemic in both patches when humans move between the two patches.},

abstract = {Different extensions of the classical single-strain SIR model for the host population, motivated by modeling dengue fever epidemiology, have reported a rich dynamic structure including deterministic chaos which was able to mimic the large fluctuations of disease incidences. A comparison between the basic two-strain dengue model, which already captures differences between primary and secondary infections including temporary cross-immunity, with the four-strain dengue model, that introduces the idea of competition of multiple strains in dengue epidemics shows that the difference between first and secondary infections drives the rich dynamics more than the detailed number of strains to be considered in the model structure. Chaotic dynamics were found to happen in the same parameter region of interest, for both the two and the four-strain models, able to describe the fluctuations observed in empirical data and shows a qualitatively good agreement between empirical data and model simulation. The predictability of the system does not change significantly when considering two or four strains, i.e. both models present a positive dominant Lyapunov exponent giving approximately the same prediction horizon in time series. Since the law of parsimony favors the simplest of two competing models, the two-strain model would be the better candidate to be analyzed, as well the best option for estimating all initial conditions and the few model parameters based on the available incidence data. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

They make some interesting points about secondary infections and ADE, arguing that since secondary infections are more likely to be hospitalized, that they should contribute less to the force of infection. They're also mainly interested in predicting DHF incidence, so accounting for secondary infections is more important.},

Urban space and time are also two important dimensions to describe the dynamics of an outbreak. The aim of this study was to evaluate the existence of a spatial correlation of the incidence of dengue and to identify variables that explain the spatial dependence in a medium-sized city of Brazil. We analyzed registered autochthonous dengue cases from September 1994 to August 2002 correlating them with socioeconomic, demographic and environmental variables using the Moran index. Our results indicate spatial dependence of the incidence of dengue and that socioeconomic factors were critical both at the beginning of the study and later on; other variables related to the organization of urban space were also involved in the occurrence of the disease. The use of spatial analysis tools is important to identify critical control areas with several variables intimately related to the modulation of the disease dynamics.},

abstract = {In many countries in Asia and South-America dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) has become a substantial public health concern leading to serious social-economic costs. Mathematical models describing the transmission of dengue viruses have focussed on the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect and temporary cross-immunity trying to explain the irregular behavior of dengue epidemics by analyzing available data. However, no systematic investigation of the possible dynamical structures has been performed so far. Our study focuses on a seasonally forced (non-autonomous) model with temporary cross-immunity and possible secondary infection, motivated by dengue fever epidemiology. The notion of at least two different strains is needed in a minimalistic model to describe differences between primary infections, often asymptomatic, and secondary infection, associated with the severe form of the disease. We extend the previously studied non-seasonal (autonomous) model by adding seasonal forcing, mimicking the vectorial dynamics, and a low import of infected individuals, which is realistic in the dynamics of dengue fever epidemics. A comparative study between three different scenarios (non-seasonal, low seasonal and high seasonal with a low import of infected individuals) is performed. The extended models show complex dynamics and qualitatively a good agreement between empirical DHF monitoring data and the obtained model simulation. We discuss the role of seasonal forcing and the import of infected individuals in such systems, the biological relevance and its implications for the analysis of the available dengue data. At the moment only such minimalistic models have a chance to be qualitatively understood well and eventually tested against existing data. The simplicity of the model (low number of parameters and state variables) offer a promising perspective on parameter values inference from the DHF case notifications. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding how socioecological factors affect the transmission of dengue fever (DF) may help to develop an early warning system of DF.

OBJECTIVES: We examined the impact of socioecological factors on the transmission of DF and assessed potential predictors of locally acquired and overseas-acquired cases of DF in Queensland, Australia.

METHODS: We obtained data from Queensland Health on the numbers of notified DF cases by local government area (LGA) in Queensland for the period 1 January 2002 through 31 December 2005. Data on weather and the socioeconomic index were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, respectively. A Bayesian spatial conditional autoregressive model was fitted at the LGA level to quantify the relationship between DF and socioecological factors.

RESULTS: Our estimates suggest an increase in locally acquired DF of 6{\%} [95{\%} credible interval (CI): 2{\%}, 11{\%}] and 61{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2{\%}, 241{\%}) in association with a 1-mm increase in average monthly rainfall and a 1°C increase in average monthly maximum temperature between 2002 and 2005, respectively. By contrast, overseas-acquired DF cases increased by 1{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0{\%}, 3{\%}) and by 1{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0{\%}, 2{\%}) in association with a 1-mm increase in average monthly rainfall and a 1-unit increase in average socioeconomic index, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: Socioecological factors appear to influence the transmission of DF in Queensland, but the drivers of locally acquired and overseas-acquired DF may differ. DF risk is spatially clustered with different patterns for locally acquired and overseas-acquired cases.},

The immunological interactions between serotypes are of central importance in understanding epidemiological dynamics and anticipating the impact of dengue vaccines. We analysed a 38-year time series with 12 197 serotyped dengue infections from a hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Using novel mechanistic models to represent different hypothesized immune interactions between serotypes, we found strong evidence that infection with dengue provides substantial short-term cross-protection against other serotypes (approx. 1-3 years). This is the first quantitative evidence that short-term cross-protection exists since human experimental infection studies performed in the 1950s. These findings will impact strategies for designing dengue vaccine studies, future multi-strain modelling efforts, and our understanding of evolutionary pressures in multi-strain disease systems.},

Because no proven vaccines are available, dengue prevention is primarily accomplished through controlling the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. While dispersal distance is generally believed to be approximately 100 m, patterns of dispersion may vary in urban areas due to landscape features acting as barriers or corridors to dispersal. Anthropogenic features ultimately affect the flow of genes affecting vector competence and insecticide resistance.

abstract = {Dengue is a systemic viral infection transmitted between humans by Aedes mosquitoes. For some patients, dengue is a life-threatening illness. There are currently no licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics, and substantial vector control efforts have not stopped its rapid emergence and global spread. The contemporary worldwide distribution of the risk of dengue virus infection and its public health burden are poorly known. Here we undertake an exhaustive assembly of known records of dengue occurrence worldwide, and use a formal modelling framework to map the global distribution of dengue risk. We then pair the resulting risk map with detailed longitudinal information from dengue cohort studies and population surfaces to infer the public health burden of dengue in 2010. We predict dengue to be ubiquitous throughout the tropics, with local spatial variations in risk influenced strongly by rainfall, temperature and the degree of urbanization. Using cartographic approaches, we estimate there to be 390 million (95{\%} credible interval 284-528) dengue infections per year, of which 96 million (67-136) manifest apparently (any level of disease severity). This infection total is more than three times the dengue burden estimate of the World Health Organization. Stratification of our estimates by country allows comparison with national dengue reporting, after taking into account the probability of an apparent infection being formally reported. The most notable differences are discussed. These new risk maps and infection estimates provide novel insights into the global, regional and national public health burden imposed by dengue. We anticipate that they will provide a starting point for a wider discussion about the global impact of this disease and will help to guide improvements in disease control strategies using vaccine, drug and vector control methods, and in their economic evaluation.},

abstract = {In metropolitan areas people travel frequently and extensively but often in highly structured commuting patterns. We investigate the role of this type of human movement in the epidemiology of vector-borne pathogens such as dengue. Analysis is based on a metapopulation model where mobile humans connect static mosquito subpopulations. We find that, due to frequency dependent biting, infection incidence in the human and mosquito populations is almost independent of the duration of contact. If the mosquito population is not uniformly distributed between patches the transmission potential of the pathogen at the metapopulation level, as summarized by the basic reproductive number, is determined by the size of the largest subpopulation and reduced by stronger connectivity. Global extinction of the pathogen is less likely when increased human movement enhances the rescue effect but, in contrast to classical theory, it is not minimized at an intermediate level of connectivity. We conclude that hubs and reservoirs of infection can be places people visit frequently but briefly and the relative importance of human and mosquito populations in maintaining the pathogen depends on the distribution of the mosquito population and the variability in human travel patterns. These results offer an insight in to the paradoxical observation of resurgent urban vector-borne disease despite increased investment in vector control and suggest that successful public health intervention may require a dual approach. Prospective studies can be used to identify areas with large mosquito populations that are also visited by a large fraction of the human population. Retrospective studies can be used to map recent movements of infected people, pinpointing the mosquito subpopulation from which they acquired the infection and others to which they may have transmitted it.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comprehensive, longitudinal field studies that monitor both disease and vector populations for dengue viruses are urgently needed as a pre-requisite for developing locally adaptable prevention programs or to appropriately test and license new vaccines.

METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report the results from such a study spanning 5 years in the Amazonian city of Iquitos, Peru where DENV infection was monitored serologically among approximately 2,400 members of a neighborhood-based cohort and through school-based absenteeism surveillance for active febrile illness among a subset of this cohort. At baseline, 80{\%} of the study population had DENV antibodies, seroprevalence increased with age, and significant geographic variation was observed, with neighborhood-specific age-adjusted rates ranging from 67.1 to 89.9{\%}. During the first 15 months, when DENV-1 and DENV-2 were co-circulating, population-based incidence rates ranged from 2-3 infections/100 person-years (p-years). The introduction of DENV-3 during the last half of 2001 was characterized by 3 distinct periods: amplification over at least 5-6 months, replacement of previously circulating serotypes, and epidemic transmission when incidence peaked at 89 infections/100 p-years.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Neighborhood-specific baseline seroprevalence rates were not predictive of geographic incidence patterns prior to the DENV-3 introduction, but were closely mirrored during the invasion of this serotype. Transmission varied geographically, with peak incidence occurring at different times among the 8 geographic zones in approximately 16 km(2) of the city. The lag from novel serotype introduction to epidemic transmission and knowledge of spatially explicit areas of elevated risk should be considered for more effective application of limited resources for dengue prevention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Based on spatiotemporal clustering of human dengue virus (DENV) infections, transmission is thought to occur at fine spatiotemporal scales by horizontal transfer of virus between humans and mosquito vectors. To define the dimensions of local transmission and quantify the factors that support it, we examined relationships between infected humans and Aedes aegypti in Thai villages.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Geographic cluster investigations of 100-meter radius were conducted around DENV-positive and DENV-negative febrile "index" cases (positive and negative clusters, respectively) from a longitudinal cohort study in rural Thailand. Child contacts and Ae. aegypti from cluster houses were assessed for DENV infection. Spatiotemporal, demographic, and entomological parameters were evaluated. In positive clusters, the DENV infection rate among child contacts was 35.3{\%} in index houses, 29.9{\%} in houses within 20 meters, and decreased with distance from the index house to 6.2{\%} in houses 80-100 meters away (p<0.001). Significantly more Ae. aegypti were DENV-infectious (i.e., DENV-positive in head/thorax) in positive clusters (23/1755; 1.3{\%}) than negative clusters (1/1548; 0.1{\%}). In positive clusters, 8.2{\%} of mosquitoes were DENV-infectious in index houses, 4.2{\%} in other houses with DENV-infected children, and 0.4{\%} in houses without infected children (p<0.001). The DENV infection rate in contacts was 47.4{\%} in houses with infectious mosquitoes, 28.7{\%} in other houses in the same cluster, and 10.8{\%} in positive clusters without infectious mosquitoes (p<0.001). Ae. aegypti pupae and adult females were more numerous only in houses containing infectious mosquitoes.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Human and mosquito infections are positively associated at the level of individual houses and neighboring residences. Certain houses with high transmission risk contribute disproportionately to DENV spread to neighboring houses. Small groups of houses with elevated transmission risk are consistent with over-dispersion of transmission (i.e., at a given point in time, people/mosquitoes from a small portion of houses are responsible for the majority of transmission).},

abstract = {The use of vector surveillance tools for preventing dengue disease requires fine assessment of risk, in order to improve vector control activities. Nevertheless, the thresholds between vector detection and dengue fever occurrence are currently not well established. In Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais, Brazil), dengue has been endemic for several years. From January 2007 to June 2008, the dengue vector Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti was monitored by ovitrap, the sticky-trap MosquiTRAP™ and larval surveys in an study area in Belo Horizonte. Using a space-time scan for clusters detection implemented in SaTScan software, the vector presence recorded by the different monitoring methods was evaluated. Clusters of vectors and dengue fever were detected. It was verified that ovitrap and MosquiTRAP vector detection methods predicted dengue occurrence better than larval survey, both spatially and temporally. MosquiTRAP and ovitrap presented similar results of space-time intersections to dengue fever clusters. Nevertheless ovitrap clusters presented longer duration periods than MosquiTRAP ones, less acuratelly signalizing the dengue risk areas, since the detection of vector clusters during most of the study period was not necessarily correlated to dengue fever occurrence. It was verified that ovitrap clusters occurred more than 200 days (values ranged from 97.0±35.35 to 283.0±168.4 days) before dengue fever clusters, whereas MosquiTRAP clusters preceded dengue fever clusters by approximately 80 days (values ranged from 65.5±58.7 to 94.0±14. 3 days), the former showing to be more temporally precise. Thus, in the present cluster analysis study MosquiTRAP presented superior results for signaling dengue transmission risks both geographically and temporally. Since early detection is crucial for planning and deploying effective preventions, MosquiTRAP showed to be a reliable tool and this method provides groundwork for the development of even more precise tools.},

abstract = {The expense and ineffectiveness of drift-based insecticide aerosols to control dengue epidemics has led to suppression strategies based on eliminating larval breeding sites. With the notable but short-lived exceptions of Cuba and Singapore, these source reduction efforts have met with little documented success; failure has chiefly been attributed to inadequate participation of the communities involved. The present work attempts to estimate transmission thresholds for dengue based on an easily-derived statistic, the standing crop of Aedes aegypti pupae per person in the environment. We have developed these thresholds for use in the assessment of risk of transmission and to provide targets for the actual degree of suppression required to prevent or eliminate transmission in source reduction programs. The notion of thresholds is based on 2 concepts: the mass action principal-the course of an epidemic is dependent on the rate of contact between susceptible hosts and infectious vectors, and threshold theory-the introduction of a few infectious individuals into a community of susceptible individuals will not give rise to an outbreak unless the density of vectors exceeds a certain critical level. We use validated transmission models to estimate thresholds as a function of levels of pre-existing antibody levels in human populations, ambient air temperatures, and size and frequency of viral introduction. Threshold levels were estimated to range between about 0.5 and 1.5 Ae. aegypti pupae per person for ambient air temperatures of 28 degrees C and initial seroprevalences ranging between 0{\%} to 67{\%}. Surprisingly, the size of the viral introduction used in these studies, ranging between 1 and 12 infectious individuals per year, was not seen to significantly influence the magnitude of the threshold. From a control perspective, these results are not particularly encouraging. The ratio of Ae. aegypti pupae to human density has been observed in limited field studies to range between 0.3 and >60 in 25 sites in dengue-endemic or dengue-susceptible areas in the Caribbean, Central America, and Southeast Asia. If, for purposes of illustration, we assume an initial seroprevalence of 33{\%}, the degree of suppression required to essentially eliminate the possibility of summertime transmission in Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Bangkok, Thailand was estimated to range between 10{\%} and 83{\%}; however in Mexico and Trinidad, reductions of >90{\%} would be required. A clearer picture of the actual magnitude of the reductions required to eliminate the threat of transmission is provided by the ratio of the observed standing crop of Ae. aegypti pupae per person and the threshold. For example, in a site in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, the ratio of observed and threshold was 1.7, meaning roughly that about 7 of every 17 breeding containers would have to be eliminated. For Reynosa, Mexico, with a ratio of approximately 10, 9 of every 10 containers would have to be eliminated. For sites in Trinidad with ratios averaging approximately 25, the elimination of 24 of every 25 would be required. With the exceptions of Cuba and Singapore, no published reports of sustained source reduction efforts have achieved anything near these levels of reductions in breeding containers. Practical advice on the use of thresholds is provided for operational control projects.

Trap sensitivity (positive MosquiTRAP index) increased significantly when 1-8 MosquiTRAPs were installed per block in both high and low abundance areas. A strong fit was obtained for the total number of mosquitoes captured with increasing trap densities through a non-linear function (Box-Lucas) (r² = 0,994), which likely exhibits saturation towards an equilibrium level. The capacity of the Mean Female Aedes Index to distinguish between areas of high and low Ae. aegypti abundance was also investigated; the achieved differentiation was shown to be dependent on the MosquiTRAP density.},

A total number of 89,607 cases registered in the surveillance system from 1996 to 2002 were analyzed. Seven epidemic waves were identified during this period. Cases were grouped into 2,563 census areas, and three risk categories were proposed based on how many times each area reached a threshold established for each epidemic wave. The association between the risk categories and the socioeconomic, demographic and urban-infrastructure characteristics was evaluated. Analysis included Kruskal-Wallis test variance comparisons and multivariate regression using multinomial models. Incidence rates differed significantly among the three risk categories in most of the epidemic waves. The factors that best characterized the areas were low educational level (< or =4 years of schooling), low income of the head of the family (< or =2 minimum wages per household), household density, and proportion of children and elderly women. Information related to basic sanitation was not enough to discriminate levels of susceptibility to dengue, and study of population density and concentration of establishments considered vulnerable to vector infestation yielded questionable results. It is important to consider different levels of exposure of the population to explain the heterogeneous pattern of distribution of dengue cases in an urban setting. Understanding the dynamics of dengue fever is essential for surveillance purposes, to improve control measures and to avoid epidemics of this disease.},

However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be confident in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples (both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the presence of inevitable but quantifiable uncertainties, even if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic compromises.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The survival of adult female Aedes mosquitoes is a critical component of their ability to transmit pathogens such as dengue viruses. One of the principal determinants of Aedes survival is temperature, which has been associated with seasonal changes in Aedes populations and limits their geographical distribution. The effects of temperature and other sources of mortality have been studied in the field, often via mark-release-recapture experiments, and under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Survival results differ and reconciling predictions between the two settings has been hindered by variable measurements from different experimental protocols, lack of precision in measuring survival of free-ranging mosquitoes, and uncertainty about the role of age-dependent mortality in the field.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Here we apply generalised additive models to data from 351 published adult Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus survival experiments in the laboratory to create survival models for each species across their range of viable temperatures. These models are then adjusted to estimate survival at different temperatures in the field using data from 59 Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus field survivorship experiments. The uncertainty at each stage of the modelling process is propagated through to provide confidence intervals around our predictions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our results indicate that adult Ae. albopictus has higher survival than Ae. aegypti in the laboratory and field, however, Ae. aegypti can tolerate a wider range of temperatures. A full breakdown of survival by age and temperature is given for both species. The differences between laboratory and field models also give insight into the relative contributions to mortality from temperature, other environmental factors, and senescence and over what ranges these factors can be important.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results support the importance of producing site-specific mosquito survival estimates. By including fluctuating temperature regimes, our models provide insight into seasonal patterns of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus population dynamics that may be relevant to seasonal changes in dengue virus transmission. Our models can be integrated with Aedes and dengue modelling efforts to guide and evaluate vector control, better map the distribution of disease and produce early warning systems for dengue epidemics.},

abstract = {Dengue viruses are major contributors to illness and death globally. Here we analyze the extrinsic and intrinsic incubation periods (EIP and IIP), in the mosquito and human, respectively. We identified 146 EIP observations from 8 studies and 204 IIP observations from 35 studies. These data were fitted with censored Bayesian time-to-event models. The best-fitting temperature-dependent EIP model estimated that 95{\%} of EIPs are between 5 and 33 days at 25°C, and 2 and 15 days at 30°C, with means of 15 and 6.5 days, respectively. The mean IIP estimate was 5.9 days, with 95{\%} expected between days 3 and 10. Differences between serotypes were not identified for either incubation period. These incubation period models should be useful in clinical diagnosis, outbreak investigation, prevention and control efforts, and mathematical modeling of dengue virus transmission.},

abstract = {Dengue is the most prevalent arboviral disease of humans. The host and virus variables associated with dengue virus (DENV) transmission from symptomatic dengue cases (n = 208) to Aedes aegypti mosquitoes during 407 independent exposure events was defined. The 50{\%} mosquito infectious dose for each of DENV-1-4 ranged from 6.29 to 7.52 log10 RNA copies/mL of plasma. Increasing day of illness, declining viremia, and rising antibody titers were independently associated with reduced risk of DENV transmission. High early DENV plasma viremia levels in patients were a marker of the duration of human infectiousness, and blood meals containing high concentrations of DENV were positively associated with the prevalence of infectious mosquitoes 14 d after blood feeding. Ambulatory dengue cases had lower viremia levels compared with hospitalized dengue cases but nonetheless at levels predicted to be infectious to mosquitoes. These data define serotype-specific viremia levels that vaccines or drugs must inhibit to prevent DENV transmission.},

abstract = {We have developed a pair of stochastic simulation models that describe the daily dynamics of dengue virus transmission in the urban environment. Our goal has been to construct comprehensive models that take into account the majority of factors known to influence dengue epidemiology. The models have an orientation toward site-specific data and are designed to be used by operational programs as well as researchers. The first model, the container-inhabiting mosquito simulation model (CIMSiM), a weather-driven dynamic life-table model of container-inhabiting mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti, provides inputs to the tranmission model, the dengue simulation model (DENSiM); a description and validation of the entomology model was published previously. The basis of the transmission model is the simulation of a human population growing in response to country- and age-specific birth and death rates. An accounting of individual serologies is maintained by type of dengue virus, reflecting infection and birth to seropositive mothers. Daily estimates of adult mosquito survival, gonotrophic development, and the weight and number of emerging females from the CIMSiM are used to create the biting mosquito population in the DENSiM. The survival and emergence values determine the size of the population while the rate of gonotrophic development and female weight estimates influence biting frequency. Temperature and titer of virus in the human influences the extrinsic incubation period; titer may also influence the probability of transfer of virus from human to mosquito. The infection model within the DENSiM accounts for the development of virus within individuals and its passage between both populations. As in the case of the CIMSiM, the specific values used for any particular phenomenon are on menus where they can be readily changed. It is possible to simulate concurrent epidemics involving different serotypes. To provide a modicum of validation and to demonstrate the parameterization process for a specific location, we compare simulation results with reports on the nature of epidemics and seroprevalence of antibody in Honduras in low-lying coastal urbanizations and Tegucigalpa following the initial introduction of dengue-1 in 1978 into Central America. We conclude with some additional examples of simulation results to give an indication of the types of questions that can be investigated with the models.},

abstract = {The effect of host availability at 6 h, 12 h and 24 h intervals on temporal variation in median host-biting frequency, oviposition and survival of the mosquito, Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus), was investigated under laboratory conditions. In each feeding interval, ten replicates containing five mosquitoes were assessed over 12 days. Median host-biting frequencies were 0.7 bites per female mosquito in the 24 h feeding interval, 0.54 bites per female in the 12 h feeding interval, and 0.47 bites per female in the 6 h feeding interval. Although the 24 h figure was comparable to previously documented levels, feeding increased by 1.5 and 2.7 fold in the 12 and 6 h feeding intervals over a 24 h period. Host biting and oviposition were observed to peak at dusk in the 6, 12 and 24 h feeding intervals, but substantial activity was also observed at dawn, noon and midnight. Daily feeding analysis showed that host biting decreased by approximately 50{\%} in all feeding interval trials over the 12 day test period. Oviposition peaks coincided with biting decline, suggesting a three day gonotrophic cycle. Survival did not differ significantly between feeding intervals. The reported rate of 0.47 host bites per female mosquito per 6 h (congruent to 1.9 per 24 h) is thus far the highest recorded for A. aegypti. The suggestion that A. aegypti probably feeds more regularly than once in a 24 h period in nature is consistent with the biting and oviposition results.},

abstract = {We used a histologic technique to study multiple blood feeding in a single gonotrophic cycle by engorged Aedes aegypti (L.) that were collected weekly for 2 yr from houses in a rural village in Thailand (n = 1,891) and a residential section of San Juan, Puerto Rico (n = 1,675). Overall, mosquitoes from Thailand contained significantly more multiple meals (n = 1,300, 42{\%} double meals, 5{\%} triple meals) than mosquitoes collected in Puerto Rico (n = 1,156, 32{\%} double meals, 2{\%} triple meals). The portion of specimens for which frequency of feeding could not be determined was 31{\%} at both sites. We estimated that on average Ae. aegypti take 0.76 and 0.63 human blood meals per day in Thailand and Puerto Rico, respectively. However, frequency of multiple feeding varied among houses and, in Puerto Rico, the neighborhoods from which mosquitoes were collected. In Thailand 65{\%} of the mosquitoes fed twice on the same day, whereas in Puerto Rico 57{\%} took multiple meals separated by {\textgreater} or = 1 d. At both sites, the majority of engorged specimens were collected inside houses (Thailand 86{\%}, Puerto Rico 95{\%}). The number of blood meals detected was independent of where mosquitoes were collected (inside versus outside of the house) at both sites and the time of day collections were made in Puerto Rico. Feeding rates were slightly higher for mosquitoes collected in the afternoon in Thailand. Temperatures were significantly higher and mosquitoes significantly smaller in Thailand than in Puerto Rico. At both sites female size was negatively associated with temperature. Rates of multiple feeding were associated positively with temperature and negatively with mosquito size in Thailand, but not in Puerto Rico. Multiple feeding during a single gonotrophic cycle is a regular part of Ae. aegypti biology, can vary geographically and under different climate conditions, and may be associated with variation in patterns of dengue virus transmission.},

abstract = {Most studies on the ability of insect populations to transmit pathogens consider only constant temperatures and do not account for realistic daily temperature fluctuations that can impact vector-pathogen interactions. Here, we show that diurnal temperature range (DTR) affects two important parameters underlying dengue virus (DENV) transmission by Aedes aegypti. In two independent experiments using different DENV serotypes, mosquitoes were less susceptible to virus infection and died faster under larger DTR around the same mean temperature. Large DTR (20 °C) decreased the probability of midgut infection, but not duration of the virus extrinsic incubation period (EIP), compared with moderate DTR (10 °C) or constant temperature. A thermodynamic model predicted that at mean temperatures {\textless}18 °C, DENV transmission increases as DTR increases, whereas at mean temperatures {\textgreater}18 °C, larger DTR reduces DENV transmission. The negative impact of DTR on Ae. aegypti survival indicates that large temperature fluctuations will reduce the probability of vector survival through EIP and expectation of infectious life. Seasonal variation in the amplitude of daily temperature fluctuations helps to explain seasonal forcing of DENV transmission at locations where average temperature does not vary seasonally and mosquito abundance is not associated with dengue incidence. Mosquitoes lived longer and were more likely to become infected under moderate temperature fluctuations, which is typical of the high DENV transmission season than under large temperature fluctuations, which is typical of the low DENV transmission season. Our findings reveal the importance of considering short-term temperature variations when studying DENV transmission dynamics.},

abstract = {This study was conducted to evaluate dengue underreporting by Brazil's Notifiable Diseases Information System (Sistema de Informacao de Agravos de Notificacao (SINAN)). Between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2011, enhanced surveillance for acute febrile illness (AFI) was performed in a public emergency unit in Salvador, Bahia State, Brazil. Of the 3864 AFI patients identified during the 3-year study period, 997 (25.8{\%}) had laboratory evidence of dengue. Of these 997 dengue cases, 57 were reported to SINAN (sensitivity 5.7{\%}). The positive predictive value (PPV)for reporting to SINAN was 68.7{\%}, and the negative predictive value was 75.1{\%}. It was estimated that one in 4 patients with AFI had laboratory evidence of dengue. However, for every 20 dengue patients identified, only about one had been reported to SINAN as having dengue. Conversely, among the patients who were reported as having dengue, 31.2{\%} did not have the disease. By applying the estimated multiplication factor to the study period's mean annual incidence of 303.8 reported dengue cases/100 000 residents, the estimated actual mean annual dengue incidence for Salvador was 3645.7 cases/100 000 residents. It is concluded that dengue surveillance substantially underestimated disease burden in Brazil, especially in low-transmission periods. Dengue underreporting has been attributed to failure to identify persons with dengue who do not seek health care and failure to detect dengue cases among symptomatic patients seeking health care.},

We quantitatively investigated the epidemiological value of location-based contact tracing (identifying potential out-of-home exposure locations by phone interviews) to infer transmission foci where high-quality insecticide applications can be targeted. Space-time statistical modeling of data from a large epidemic affecting Cairns, Australia, in 2008{\textendash}2009 revealed a complex pattern of transmission driven primarily by human mobility (Cairns accounted for ~60\% of virus transmission to and from residents of satellite towns, and 57\% of all potential exposure locations were nonresidential). Targeted indoor residual spraying with insecticides in potential exposure locations reduced the probability of future DENV transmission by 86 to 96\%, compared to unsprayed premises. Our findings provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of combining contact tracing with residual spraying within a developed urban center, and should be directly applicable to areas with similar characteristics (for example, southern USA, Europe, or Caribbean countries) that need to control localized Aedes-borne virus transmission or to protect pregnant women{\textquoteright}s homes in areas with active Zika transmission. Future theoretical and empirical research should focus on evaluation of the applicability and scalability of this approach to endemic areas with variable population size and force of DENV infection.},

abstract = {This paper considers Bayesian counterparts of the classical tests for goodness of fit and their use in judging the fit of a single Bayesian model to the observed data. We focus on posterior predictive assessment, in a framework that also includes conditioning on auxiliary statistics. The Bayesian formulation facilitates the construction and calculation of a meaningful reference distribution not only for any (classical) statistic, but also for any parameter-dependent ``statistic" or discrepancy. The latter allows us to propose the realized discrepancy assessment of model fitness, which directly measures the true discrepancy between data and the posited model, for any aspect of the model which we want to explore. The computation required for the realized discrepancy assessment is a straightforward byproduct of the posterior simulation used for the original Bayesian analysis. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nWe illustrate with three applied examples. The first example, which serves mainly to motivate the work, illustrates the difficulty of classical tests in assessing the fitness of a Poisson model to a positron emission tomography image that is constrained to be nonnegative. The second and third examples illustrate the details of the posterior predictive approach in two problems: estimation in a model with inequality constraints on the parameters, and estimation in a mixture model. In all three examples, standard test statistics (either a X 2 or a likelihood ratio) are not pivotal: the difficulty is not just how to compute the reference distribution for the test, but that in the classical framework no such distribution exists, independent of the unknown model parameters.},

abstract = {Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Bayesian inference (or, more generally, complex statistical modeling) --which are generally considered as unrelated statistical paradigms--can be particularly ef- fective in combination. In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework for EDA based on posterior predictive checks. We explain how posterior predictive simulations can be used to create reference dis- tributions for EDA graphs, and how this approach resolves some theoretical problems in Bayesian data analysis. We show how the generalization of Bayesian inference to include replicated data yr'e and repli- cated parameters Hrep follows a long tradition of generalizations in Bayesian theory. On the theoretical level, we present a predictive Bayesian formulation of goodness-of-fit testing, dis- tinguishing between p-values (posterior probabilities that specified antisymmetric discrepancy measures will exceed 0) and u-values (data summaries with uniform sampling distributions). We explain that p- values, unlike u-values, are Bayesian probability statements in that they condition on observed data. Having reviewed the general theoretical framework, we discuss the implications for statistical graphics and exploratory data analysis, with the goal being to unify exploratory data analysis with more formal statistical methods based on probability models. We interpret various graphical displays as posterior predictive checks and discuss how Bayesian inference can be used to determine reference distributions. The goal of this work is not to downgrade descriptive statistics, or to suggest they be replaced by Bayesian modeling, but rather to suggest how exploratory data analysis fits into the probability-modeling paradigm. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for practical Bayesian inference. In particular, we an- ticipate that Bayesian software can be generalized to draw simulations of replicated data and parameters from their posterior predictive distribution, and these can in turn be used to calibrate EDA graphs.},
