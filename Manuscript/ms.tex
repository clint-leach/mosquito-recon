\section*{Introduction}

Dengue fever is a massive global public health burden, with millions of cases per year in Brazil alone \cite{Bhatt2013}.  
Since the dengue virus (DENV) is vectored by the mosquito \textit{Aedes aegypti}, dengue fever is prevented primarily through mosquito control programs \cite{Achee2015}.
To be effective, control efforts should be guided by consistent, high resolution mosquito surveillance \cite{Morrison2008}.
The "MI-Dengue" system, implemented by the company Ecovec and deployed throughout cities in Brazil, uses a city-wide grid of mosquito sticky-traps (MosquiTRAPs) for spatial prioritization of source reduction and larvicide application \cite{Eiras2009}.
Comparing cities with and without this system, \cite{Pepin2013} estimated that it prevented 27,191 cases of dengue fever from 2007 - 2011.
Though this system has been effective, the mosquito indices and thresholds used to prioritize control efforts remain somewhat ad-hoc.
As noted in \cite{Morrison2008}, entomological indices are only relevant in the context of local epidemiology, and thus control policies will be most effective when they synthesize both entomological and clinical surveillance.

Many of the attempts to link these two sources of information have found a weak relationship between mosquito surveillance and disease risk (CITATIONS).
These efforts have often relied on tests of the ability of mosquito abundance measures to predict human disease risk in regression models.
For example, \cite{Pepin2015} found that models that included MosquiTRAP surveillance data failed to predict weekly dengue cases any better than models that included lagged case data alone.
However, such tests fail to account for the mechanistic, non-linear relationship between mosquito population dynamics and dengue epidemiology.
The cycle of transmission between humans and dengue is controlled not just by mosquito abundance, but also by mosquito survival relative to the virus' incubation period \cite{Achee2015}.
In fact, whether or not an exposed mosquito will survive long enough to become infectious represents a critical bottleneck in the transmission process.

Adult \textit{Aedes aegypti} surveillance data (e.g. time series of mosquito trap counts) is insufficient on its own to estimate mosquito mortality rates.
However, we can borrow from the field of 'integrated population modeling' and combine multiple sources of information to estimate mosquito demographic rates \cite{Schaub2010}.
Since mosquito mortality is a critical bottleneck in the transmission process, it can be informed from the observed transmission dynamics (i.e. reports of human cases), given an appropriate underlying mechanistic model.

In this paper, we propose such a mechanistic model to connect mosquito abundance and survival with dengue epidemiology.
We then embed this model into a Bayesian statistical framework that allows us to estimate latent time series of mosquito demographic parameters from time series of mosquito trap counts and reported cases of dengue fever.
Lastly, we use the fitted model to explore the optimal timing of adult control interventions.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Study system and data}

Vitoria is a coastal city and the capital of the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil, with a population of 327,801 in the city proper, and an additional 1.5 million people in the greater metropolitan area.  
Since 2008, the company Ecovec has monitored mosquito abundance for the city using approximately 1327 sticky traps (MosquiTRAP, \cite{Eiras2009}) arranged in a grid across the city.
Each trap is checked weekly and the mosquitoes inside counted and identified, providing us with 243 weeks (2008 through week 34 of 2012) of counts of gravid female \emph{Aedes aegypti}.
Dengue is a mandatory notifiable disease, and thus the city's Ministry of Health Secretary maintains a database of weekly notified probable dengue cases (i.e. medical care sought for dengue-like symptoms) for this same time period.

\subsection*{Process Model}

Dengue epidemiology is complicated considerably by the presence of four simultaneously circulating serotypes (referred to as DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4).
Infection with one serotype confers life-long immunity to that serotype, along with temporary immunity to other serotypes.  
As this cross-immunity wanes, antibodies from the previous infection can actually result in antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), wherein hosts are more susceptible to infection with the other serotypes and more likely to develop severe symptoms (i.e. dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome).
The strength and duration of these different inter-serotype interactions are not well understood, though different models suggest that temporary cross-immunity alone (without ADE) is sufficient to reproduce observed multi-annual dynamics in Thailand \cite{Wearing2006,Reich2013}.
Similarly, \cite{Aguiar2013} find that capturing both primary and secondary infections and the period of cross-immunity is critical, but that explicitly including all four serotypes (at great cost to model complexity) does not perform much better than a two serotype model.

Explicitly accounting for interactions between serotypes, even only two of the four, leads to a large and complex mechanistic model.
Moreover, since dengue case reports do not include information on serotype, we do not have enough information to inform the dynamics of individual serotypes.
As such, we simplify the model of \cite{Wearing2006} to an SEIRS framework, which drops serotype-specific dynamics but preserves the period of cross-immunity and the possibility of reinfection.
In this framework, susceptible individuals ($S$) become exposed ($E$) through contact with infectious mosquitoes ($V_I$).
Following a latent period ($\frac{1}{\rho}$), exposed individuals become infectious ($I$) at which point they can infect susceptible mosquitoes ($V_S$).
Infectious individuals recover at rate $\gamma$ and subsequently remain immune for a period ($\frac{1}{\delta}$) after which they re-enter the susceptible class.

Similarly, susceptible mosquitoes ($V_S$) become exposed by biting infectious humans and pass through a temperature-dependent latent period ($\frac{1}{\rho_{vt}}$) before becoming infectious ($V_I$).
Total mosquito population size ($V_N$) is controlled by stochastic, seasonally varying growth rate ($r(t)$) and death rate ($d(t)$).
Captured mosquitoes ($V_C$) accumulate at rate $\phi_q \tau_t$, where $\phi_q$ is the per-trap capture rate, and $\tau_t$ is the number of traps deployed in week $t$.

The complete differential equation model is then given as:
\begin{align} 
\frac{dS}{dt} &= bN - bS - \lambda \frac{V_{I}}{N} S + \delta R\\
\frac{dE}{dt} &= \lambda \frac{V_{I}}{N} S - (\rho + b)E\\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \rho E - (\gamma + b)I\\
\frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma I - (\delta + b)R\\
\frac{dV_N}{dt} & = r V_N - \phi_q \tau_t V_N \\
\frac{dV_E}{dt} &= \lambda \frac{I}{N} V_S - (\rho_{vt} + d + \phi_q \tau_t)V_E\\
\frac{dV_I}{dt} &= \rho_{vt} V_E - (d + \phi_q \tau_t) V_I\\
\frac{dV_C}{dt} & = \phi_q \tau_t V_N\\
V_S &= V_N - V_E - V_I.
\end{align}

We model the centered and log-transformed mosquito mortality rate ($\nu$) and the per-capita growth rate ($r$) as forced harmonic oscillators with natural periods of one year:
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2\nu}{dt^2} &= -\omega^2 \nu + \epsilon_{\nu t}\\
\frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} &= -\omega^2 r + \epsilon_{rt},
\end{align}
where $\omega = 2\pi / 52$, $d(t) = d_0 \exp(\nu(t))$, and
\begin{align}
\epsilon_{\nu i} & \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_{\nu})\\
\epsilon_{ri} & \sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_r),
\end{align}
for $i = 1 \dots 243$.
These stochastically-forced harmonic oscillators provide a flexible framework for generating smooth seasonal oscillations in the latent mosquito processes \cite{Ramsay2017}.

\subsection*{Data model}

To connect the differential equation model the the observed case reports, we add an extra state, $C$, that collects the cumulative number of transitions from the exposed to infectious class (assuming that case reporting coincides with the onset of symptoms).
We then model the number of new cases reported in week $t$ ($y_t$) as:
\begin{equation}
y_t  \sim \text{NegBin}(\phi_y (C_t - C_{t-1}), \eta_y),
\end{equation}
where $\phi_y$ is the reporting probability, $C_t - C_{t-1}$ is the number of new infectious individuals in week $t$, and $\eta_y$ controls the overdispersion relative to the Poisson.

We similarly model the number of mosquitoes trapped in week $t$ ($q_t$) as:
\begin{equation}
q_t \sim \text{NegBin}(V_{Ct} - V_{Ct-1}, \eta_q),
\end{equation}
where $V_{Ct} - V_{Ct-1}$ is the number of new mosquitoes captured in week $t$, and $\eta_q$ controls overdispersion relative to the Poisson.

\subsection*{Parameterization and priors}

Several of the parameters in this model are assumed to be fixed and known (Table 1).
The population size and average life span (which we use to parameterize the birth/death rate) for Vitoria are taken from the 2010 census.
To maintain identifiability, the transmission rate ($\lambda$) and case reporting probability ($\phi_y$) are also fixed at literature values.
Lastly, the extrinsic incubation period in mosquitoes is modeled as a function of weekly mean temperature and forced with weather station data obtained from WeatherUnderground.

The remaining parameters include the epidemiological parameters ($\rho$, $\gamma$, $\delta$), the initial conditions of the model ($S_0$, $E_0$, $I_0$, $R_0$, $V_{N0}, \nu_0, r_0$), the variances of the latent mosquito processes ($\sigma^2_r$, $\sigma^2_{\nu}$), and the remaining measurement parameters ($\phi_q$, $\eta_y$, $\eta_q$).  
Where possible, we place informative priors on these parameters based on existing laboratory and field studies (see Table 1 for means and Supplemental Material for detailed explanations).

\subsection*{Implementation}
 
Samples from the posterior distribution were generated using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo implemented in the rstan package \cite{Carpenter2016, Rstan2017} for R \cite{R2016}. 
We ran 3 chains with different starting values for 10,000 iterations each, discarding the first 5,000 as burn-in.
Within stan, the solution to the differential equation model was approximated with an Euler scheme with a time step of 1 day.  

\subsection*{Control simulations}

Given samples from the posterior as obtained above, we can simulate the efficacy of different control strategies.
In particular, we investigate the optimal timing of a single pulse of control within the year (e.g., if the city only has enough resource to fog for adult mosquitoes once a year, in what week is that control going to prevent the most cases?).
To obtain the posterior distribution of the number of cases prevented by implementing control in week $i$ each year, for each posterior sample $k$, we simulate an increase in the latent mosquito death rate during each week $i$, e.g.,
$\hat{d}^{(k)}_{yi} = (1 + \Delta) d^{(k)}_{yi}$, where $y$ indexes the year, and $i$ indexes the week of the year.
Then we sum the total number of cases reported in this scenario and compare to the data to get an estimate of the number of cases prevented.
To keep our simulations conservative, and to avoid pushing the model into the unrealistic range of dengue eradication, we set $\Delta = 0.05$.
We also only simulate the effect of control in the middle three years, as the effectiveness of control in the first year is strongly affected by initial conditions, and we lack complete data for the last year.

\section*{Results}

The model is able to capture the observed dynamics of both case reports and mosquito trap counts (Figure \ref{timeseries}).
The estimated posterior median case reports explain 91\% of the variation in the observed time series, while the posterior median mosquito trap counts explain 45\% of the variation in the observed time series. 
In addition, posterior predictive checks show that the model reproduces the the total number of cases reported and mosquitoes captured as well as the autocorrelation structure of both time series (with the exception of slightly underestimating the autocorrelation for short lags, Supplemental Fig XX - XX).
Posterior means for the three epidemiological parameters ($\rho, \gamma, \delta$) are close to the literature values used to set their prior means (Supplemental Fig XX).

The estimated latent mosquito demographic rates are smooth and strongly seasonal, with fairly narrow credible intervals (Figure \ref{latent}).
Mosquito mortality rates fluctuate within the range estimated by \cite{Brady2013} and generally increase with temperature (Figure \ref{temp}).
The underlying process variances are small ($\sigma_{\nu} = 0.01$, $\sigma_r = 0.0005$), and there is little residual structure in the process noise series, though there is a weak periodic signal in the $\epsilon_{\nu}$ (Supplemental Fig XX).

Modifying these estimated demographic rates to simulate targeted control efforts, we find that control applied in the third week of the year is the most effective at preventing cases of dengue fever (though weeks 2 and 4 are also very close, Figure \ref{control}A).
In fact, increasing the mosquito mortality rate by just 5\% in the third week of 2009, 2010, and 2011 would prevent 13,988 (reported) cases of dengue fever (with 80\% credible interval of 11,130 to 15,811).
Most of these gains come by way of substantially reducing the size of the large 2011 outbreak, while also further damping the smaller 2010 and 2012 outbreaks (Figure \ref{control}B).
Targeting larvae instead of adults (simulated by reducing the birth rate ($b_t = r_t + d_t$) by 5\%) produces nearly identical results.

The third week of the year is generally very early in the dengue season, well before cases peak (Figure \ref{timing}).
In the two years with large outbreaks (2009 and 2011), the third week of the year is near the inflection point where the disease burden begins to grow rapidly.  
The third week is also generally before the estimated seasonal peak in mosquito abundance, which occurs between weeks 6 and 9 (Figure \ref{timing}).
Annual peaks in estimated mosquito mortality rate are more variable, but tend to fall between weeks 2 and 7.
Though mosquito death rates tend to be high early in the year, the transmission risk (i.e. the probability of an exposed mosquito surviving long enough to be infectious, $\frac{\rho_v}{\rho_v + d}$) does not pick up until later in the year.

\section*{Discussion}

Targeted mosquito control can be an effective tool in reducing the disease burden within a city.
When faced with limited resources with which to deploy that control, these results suggest that focusing efforts early in the year, specifically in the second to fourth weeks, will lead to the largest reductions in disease.
Because adult control (increased the mortality rate) and larval control (decreasing the birth rate) produce very similar reductions in disease, the effect of control is likely driven by reducing the standing population of adult mosquitoes, rather than by limiting the transmission potential of exposed or infectious mosquitoes.
Targeting mosquitoes early in the year as dengue just begins to spread can disrupt the transmission cycle and prevent further amplification and feedback.

The importance of reducing the population of adult mosquitoes agrees with the results of \cite{Burattini2008} whose model of dengue dynamics in Singapore suggests that killing adult mosquitoes is the most effective way to control an epidemic.
However, they find that larval control is most effective at preventing resurgence of dengue epidemics, and thus that a mixed strategy that includes both larval and adult control is likely to be most effective in the long term.
The utility of mixed control strategies is further supported by \cite{Pinho2010}, whose model of dengue in Salvador, Brazil suggests that adult control alone is insufficient to bring $R_0$ below 1 and eliminate spread.
Fully exploring such combined strategies requires a more complete model of mosquito life history and the lags in population dynamics induced by the mosquito's aquatic stage.
The lack of such an aquatic phase in our model makes it more suitable for exploring the immediate, direct effects of adult control on transmission, rather than for studying the lagged feedbacks on mosquito population dynamics (and their knock-on effects on transmission).
Though models of mosquito development can be very complex, e.g. \cite{Magori2009}, our model could be extended to incorporate a compartment for the aquatic phase (as in \cite{Burattini2008, Pinho2010}), though at the cost of introducing several new parameters to the model.

In our model, the relationship between mosquito abundance and human disease risk is controlled by mosquito mortality, which, together with the extrinsic incubation period ($\rho_v$), controls how  many exposed mosquitoes survive long enough to become infectious.
As implemented, mosquito mortality is the only source of uncertainty/stochasticity in the transmission process.
As a result, mosquito mortality could be soaking up other sources of stochasticity or model misspecification.
Our implementation of the mortality process is conceptually similar to the empirical forcing functions developed by \cite{Hooker2015}.
In that framework, \cite{Hooker2015} allow parameters of differential equation models to change over time and use the resulting time series to differentiate causes of lack-of-fit.
Though we do not employ the same explicit testing framework here, we treat the estimated mosquito mortality time series in the same spirit.
In particular, we can check whether our estimated mosquito mortality time series is mechanistically plausible.
Our estimated mosquito mortalities generally fall within the reasonable range from the literature \cite{Maciel-de-Freitas2008, Brady2013}.
The fact that our estimated mortality rate varies seasonally and increases with temperature also agrees with the empirical literature on mosquito survival.
These observations suggest that our estimated mosquito mortality rates may actually be capturing the patterns of mosquito mortality in this system and are not obviously influenced by other sources of uncertainty or misspecification.

Though the estimated mosquito mortality process seems biologically reasonable, we are still employing it to link mosquito abundance and human disease at a relatively large spatial scale, assuming homogeneous mixing between mosquitoes and humans throughout the city.
However, structured human movement within the city is likely to be a major driver of heterogeneous human-mosquito mixing \cite{Adams2009, Cosner2009a, Stoddard2009, Dalziel2013}.
In addition spatial variability in socioeconomic factors within the city may also modulate the extent to which mosquitoes in different parts of the city contribute to disease spread \cite{Mondini2008, Honorio2009, Hu2012, DeMattosAlmeida2007}.
This heterogeneity can have substantial consequences for disease dynamics.
In fact, in a modeling study \cite{Dye1986, Hasibeder1988} found that introducing heterogeneous mixing always increases $R_0$ relative to homogeneous mixing.

Though this suggests that our model may overestimate the efficacy of mosquito control, it also points the way towards more efficient and effective control methods.
If disease risk is driven by high levels of contact with a relatively small proportion of the mosquito population \cite{Canyon1999, Yoon2012}, control policies that preferentially target these subsets of the mosquito population are likely to be very effective.
Identifying these subsets is difficult in practice.
One possible strategy is through the use of contact-tracing, which can identify and target specific premises that have been directly implicated in transmission \cite{Vazquez-Prokopec2017}.
Though effective, this strategy is extremely labor-intensive and would be difficult to implement in endemic areas.

On the other hand, if we can capture this heterogeneity in a modeling framework similar to ours, that makes use of currently available surveillance data, we can explore more sophisticated, spatially targeted control strategies.
However, incorporating spatial structure into our model would involve a substantial statistical and computational burden.
Case reports data for the city of Vitoria are available for each of the city's 75 neighborhoods, but using those neighborhoods to embed the mechanistic model explicitly into a metapopulation framework leads to a very large, unwieldy mechanistic model that likely exacerbates existing difficulties inherent in fitting ODE models to data \cite{Girolami2008, Calderhead2011}.
Developing such spatial models and the methods necessary to deal with them is a promising area of future research.

\subsection*{Conclusions}

Mosquito surveillance is a valuable tool in managing dengue fever, but is most powerful when integrated into a larger modeling framework.
We have developed a simple yet realistic mechanistic model of dengue fever spread that allows us to combine mosquito and clinical surveillance to estimate the latent mosquito demographic rates that govern the critical bottleneck between mosquito abundance and human disease.
That we have done this in a fully hierarchical Bayesian framework allows for a thorough accounting of uncertainty that can be carried through to the evaluation of different control strategies.
This combination of model features meets many of the recommendations of \cite{Morrison2008, Achee2015} for developing more effective, biologically grounded, and data-driven dengue control policies and offers a building block on which these tools can be further developed in the future.
